# PAN-Number-Validation-SQL
This project cleans, validates and categorises Indian PAN numbers (Permanent Account Number) stored in a staging table. It implements the full business rule set (format checks, adjacent-character checks, sequential checks, null / duplicates handling) and outputs a summary report of valid vs invalid PANs
